            <h2> What is CSS ?</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
                <li><b><del>CSS is not neccessary</del><span class="yel"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b>b It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
                <li><ins> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</ins></li>
            </ol>
            <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
            <ul class="space">
                <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
                <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
                <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
                <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,
                    <span class="yel">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p><br>
            <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target specific element or range of elements on web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.            </p><br>
            <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to to which a style should be applied.            </p>
